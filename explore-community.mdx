The Clarifai community serves as a valuable free resource for AI developers and enthusiasts. It provides access to state-of-the-art AI models, workflows, and more to help you add AI to your own applications.

The community is divided into three main sections:

* **Models:** This section includes pre-built AI models that you can use to solve a variety of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.
* **Workflows:** This section provides templates and examples of how to use Clarifai's models to build AI applications.
* **Community:** This section is where you can connect with other AI developers and enthusiasts, ask questions, and share your work.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Clarifai community, you can create an account and explore the different resources available. You can also join the community forum to connect with other developers and get help with your projects.

## Models

Clarifai's models are trained on a massive dataset of images, videos, and text. They are available for a variety of tasks, including:

* Image classification: Identify the objects in an image.
* Object detection: Find the location of objects in an image.
* Natural language processing: Understand the meaning of text.

You can use Clarifai's models to build AI applications that can do things like:

* Classify images of products in a store.
* Detect faces in a video.
* Answer questions about text.

## Workflows

Clarifai's workflows provide templates and examples of how to use Clarifai's models to build AI applications. They can help you get started quickly and easily.

For example, the "Image Classification Workflow" shows you how to use Clarifai's image classification model to build an application that can identify the objects in an image.

## Community

The Clarifai community is a great place to connect with other AI developers and enthusiasts. You can ask questions, share your work, and get help with your projects.

The community forum is the best place to start. You can also join the community Slack channel for real-time chat.
